# secure-password-generator

This was a great experience in thinking out how to utilize variables, functions and for loops.

Conditionals also came in very handy in telling the function that generates the password which strings to concatenate based on the user input onto the main string full of characters to loop through and randomize.

This assignment helped me analyze my code and find more efficient ways to writing it to get the same output I was expecting

Also, I became more familiar with where certain variables and functions need to be sequenced as far as top-down to make sure everything was able to be utilized properly.

Overall a great learning experience to further my ability and knowledge using js.
